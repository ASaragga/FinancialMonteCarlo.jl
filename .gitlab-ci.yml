# Here, it is assumed that your Julia package is named `MonteCarlo`. Change it to
# whatever name you have given to your package.

## Maybe you would like to test your package against the development branch:
build:dev:
  stage: build
  image: julia:latest
  <<: *build_definition
test:dev:
  image: julia:latest
  stage: test
  allow_failure: true
  dependencies:
   - build:dev
  # ... allowing for failures, since we are testing against the development
  # branch:
  <<: *test_definition
  
#test:dev-Windows:
#  image: julia:0.6.3-windowsservercore-1709
#  # ... allowing for failures, since we are testing against the development
#  # branch:
#  allow_failure: true
#  <<: *test_definition

# REMARK: Do not forget to enable the coverage feature for your project, if you
# are using code coverage reporting above. This can be done by
#
# - Navigating to the `CI/CD Pipelines` settings of your project,
# - Copying and pasting the default `Simplecov` regex example provided, i.e.,
#   `\(\d+.\d+\%\) covered` in the `test coverage parsing` textfield.
